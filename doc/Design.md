Maxixe: Design
==============

Design Goals
------------

Maxixe's design goals are:

*   **Simplicity**: the implementation should be simple.  Re-implementing Maxixe in a
    different host language should be a conceivable weekend project.
    
*   **Familiarity**: proofs should look more or less like "classical" proofs which
    consist of a list of steps and the justification for each step.

*   **Explicitness**: the supplied proof must be written out completely explicitly;
    the implementation must not be made to search for any information that is not
    stated.

*   **Generality**: the proof language itself should make as few assumptions about
    the object language as possible.  In particular, it shouldn't "know logic".

*   **Predicate Logic**: on the other hand, the proof language should, when given
    the rules of predicate logic, be powerful enough to allow one to check proofs
    using predicate logic.

*   **Correctness**: the proof-checking capability of the language must not
    claim that an incorrect proof is correct for the given rules.  It would also
    be nice if it does not claim that a correct proof is incorrect.

Here are some things which are *not* goals of Maxixe:

*   **Theorem proving**.  Maxixe need only check that a proof supplied to it is a valid
    proof.  It need not search for a proof given a theorem.

*   **Efficiency**.

### How well are these goals met? ###

*   **Simplicity**: as of this writing, the reference implementation of Maxixe, in Python, is
    about 600 lines of code.  About 250 lines of that is the parser and scanner.  Another 200
    is the AST and term (matching, replacing) infrastructure.

*   **Familiarity**: aside from the term language (meaning, you have to say `impl(A,B)` instead
    of `Aâ†’B`), the layout of a proof is fairly classical.  A proof consists of a set of
    rules of inference (which includes axioms and premises), the goal to be proved, and a
    list of steps.  Each step includes a phrase "by [rule] with [previous steps]" as its
    justification.  The last step must equal the goal to be proved.

*   **Explicitness**: virtually everything must be spelled out.  Maxixe will not even search
    for what previous proof steps were used in a step.

*   **Generality**: instead of coding the rules for Existential Instantiation (etc) in
    the proof language, we have coded constraints on hypotheses and conclusions which
    allow rules like EI to be written.

*   **Predicate Logic**: see the Generality point above.  It's getting there.

*   **Correctness**: see the Disclaimer in the README.  It's probably close, but I wouldn't
    put money on it.
